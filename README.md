# Compiler construction course project
This is a compiler construction course project. The project is to implement a compiler for KPL language. The compiler is implemented in C. The compiler is implemented in three phases: Lexical Analysis, Syntax Analysis, and Semantic Analysis. The compiler generates the intermediate code in the form of three-address code. The compiler also generates the symbol table and the syntax tree
* Note: You can use the test scripts in each phase to test the compiler.
- Run with the following command:
```bash
cd Week1/src/
./test.sh
```
The test result will be displayed on the terminal and in diff.txt file.
## Week 1: Lexical Analysis
- Implementing the lexical analysis phase of the compiler.

## Week 2: Parser
- Implementing the parser phase of the compiler.
