# Compiler construction course project
This is a compiler construction course project. The project is to implement a compiler for KPL language. The compiler is implemented in Python. The compiler is implemented in three phases: Lexical Analysis, Syntax Analysis, and Semantic Analysis. The compiler generates the intermediate code in the form of three-address code. The compiler also generates the symbol table and the syntax tree
## Week 1: Lexical Analysis
- Implementing the lexical analysis phase of the compiler.
- Test using test.sh script.
